Oh man look at all of this exiting text! Whoah! ðŸš€ðŸ¦†














This is an app dedicated to teaching devs about stuff I've learned post ReactSummit and JSNation,
though I want to expand the tool to be more generic, so I can start to take notes for myself, and get a better idea of some of the software I'm building.
So far it's just a simple SPA and I think it will continue to be a simple SPA for now but I could definitely see myself re-doing a lot of this stuff in the future.
Oh wow oh boy oh man codin is mah jam!


Experimental-Web-Platform-Features MUST be enabled and in a chrome browser to use this most effectively,
I will be documenting it (somehow) on the pages that need it and the pages that don't.
I would also like to classify pages so as my tech stack evolves I can 'deprecate' documents that no longer matter.
Oh my god, I sound like a lunatic, serving documents? It's almost like that's what the internet was made for :^)

There's a lot of todos because i made this super quick
- Move stuff to react 19
- Move components to TSX
- Make the codemirror component just one component with a language that gets passed in, it's stupid to have 3 instances of this in the event a dependency changes
- Write about react 19
- Implement react compiler
- Explain how react compiler works (oh my fuccccccc--)

- I want to read more on Deno
- I should do research on honc.dev
- I want to build something ground up with tanstack.
