This is an app dedicated to teaching devs about stuff I've learned post ReactSummit and JSNation,
though I want to expand the tool to be more generic, so I can start to take notes for myself, and get a better idea of some of the software I'm building.
So far it's just a simple SPA and I think it will continue to be a simple SPA for now but I could definitely see myself re-doing a lot of this stuff in the future.
Oh wow oh boy oh man codin is mah jam!
